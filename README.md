# js-chain
> A basic cryptocurrency blockchain written in JavaScript

I am currently learning to write JavaScript applications. I also have a keen interest on blockchain technologies. I wanted to explore and learn more about this tech by learning to write my own blockchain, while also sharpening my JavaScript "saw".

## Setup
> Before you proceed, you will need to [install Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).

In your terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/gpoliko/js-chain.git
cd js-chain && npm install
``` 

## Updates
> A quick progress report on what I have been able to implement so far
- Create a single Block
- Create a hash for each Block
- Create multiple Blocks which are linked
- Implement a basic **Proof of Work** function
- Implement Transactions

## Todo (Backlog)
> List of 'stretches' or features to add
- Build a UI
- Implement authentication
    - Allow users to create "wallets"
    - Allow users to conduct transactions with each other
- Testing???
